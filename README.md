# neo-userscripts

All userscripts are technically not allowed by neopets.

That said, this collection of scripts does not automate anything big (it may automate closing a window or clicking a single button or some form input like quickstock, but not buttons/pages in sequence). It is extremely unlikely you'd be banned or even warned.

If you have a request, I'll see what I can do. I'm not against most automation unless it's really cheat-y, like Kads or restocking, but there are some scripts I would not make public here.
